## Introduction
This repository is a collection of resources I have found around "the internet" that relate to 
the learning of the nêhiyaw language (favoring Y dialect). I live in Edmonton, AB and so most of
the resources here may be more localized to that region, but not all.

### Motivation
There is no faster method for learning a new langauge than **full immersion**. However, in the case where this
is not an option (such as minimal-or-no access to fluent speakers) then it is the responsibility of the
language learner to **surround herself with every resource available to create an immersive
environment**.

**This repo represents my efforts to do so** and also my desire to share that effort with
others interested in nêhiyaw language revitalization. I've also chosen a source-code sharing platform for
several reasons:

 * allow for collaboration of resources. Facebook, various web sites and other groups have built/provided
   resources all over the place, and others have build websites trying to consolidate this information, but
   such a constant effort I think must be collaborative, the internet is constantly changing, and so we
   should all be able to add new links and such. Besise, have you ever tried to go back and find something on Facebook?
 * ease of updating. This repository can be edited online with very little effort, and is hosted instantly,
 * resources for learning marginalized languages should be free, open, and easily-accessible and so this effort shall be so as well.


The resources are out there, there's just now the work to be done.

## Tips for the beginner

 * I highly recommend you start with **Chelsea Vowel's 4-part podcast** (see below), especially if
 you have never spoken the language. This will give little background on language revitalization as
 well as a place to start. I've listened to it 3 times now.
 * Learn [SRO][1] (Standard Roman Orthography), while it still very much has one foot in the
 colonial world, almost all the written materials you encounter are going to be written using SRO.
 The paper discusses in some detail how some nêhiyawêwin-specific sounds (dipthongs) are difficult
 to represent using the english alphabet, and why SRO is important. *It's also really simple.*
 * Listen to the language **every day**. Put it on your iPhone, iPad, whatever. If I've learned
 anything in the last couple months, it's that the language **cannot be learned without being
 heard** and it cannot be spoken without practice.
 * Join the Facebook groups [Cree Simon Says][2] and [Nêhiyawêwin (Cree) Word/Phrase of the Day][3]
 as a start, there are others out there, but these are quite active with new content.
 * Get Solomon Ratt's book [mâci-nêhiyawêwin (Beginning Cree)](https://www.amazon.ca/Beginning-Cree-Solomon-Ratt/dp/0889774358), it's invaluable.
 * Don't get hung up on dialect, at least not right now. **Consume everything** and sort out the
 details later on.

 * **Podcast** - [Chelsea Vowel's](http://apihtawikosisan.com/) 4-part podcast on nêhiyawêwin language learning
   - [peyak](https://soundcloud.com/m-tis-in-space/unsettling-your-language-peyak-1) (one) - discussion on language learning and fluency

 * [Canadian Bible Society Plains Cree translations](http://www.biblesociety.ca/translation/cree-plains.html) - I want to be clear that I am active in the decolonization process, and so I am not advocating for a colonial religion. However, as an extensive audio resource for nêhiyawêwin, I haven't found anything yet that has quite the quantity of audio in cree. I try to listen to about 2-3 hours a day of the language spoken, and this is one resource I have been using. Take it or leave it.

### Video
I'm not going to list every video on the internet that has to do with cree. These one's are key and
are worth starting with.

 * **A History of the Cree Language** with Reuben Quinn - talks about the star chart (atahkipêyihkana / syllabics) and it's role at the root of the language. I've watched these three times already.

### Books
 * [100 Days of Cree](https://uofrpress.ca/Books/9/100-Days-of-Cree) another fantastic book. I told someone
